# The Art of Pairing

We're pulling back the curtain!

In this mini-lesson, both Matt and Adam will be pairing on building a ruby gem from the ground up.

## The problem

We use several APIs here in DC to manage students, attendance and assignments.

We're currently rewriting a lot of boilerplate code to connect to these APIs to get the information
and parse the JSON.

## Our goal

We want a client Ruby Gem to consume the API and format the data.

## Our steps

Matt and Adam will have a pairing session where they add the functionality and then extract it to a gem.
We'll show it all on the big screen, narrate our thoughts, and pause for questions periodically.

Come watch us in action.
